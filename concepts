## 1. Introduction to CouchDB
CouchDB is an open-source NoSQL database developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It provides a document-oriented database architecture that allows for easy scaling and flexible data storage. Unlike traditional relational databases, CouchDB stores data as JSON documents, making it more adaptable for modern web applications.

### Key Features of CouchDB:
- **Document-Oriented:** Uses JSON format for data storage.
- **RESTful API:** Accessible via HTTP, making it easy to integrate with web applications.
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC):** Ensures consistency without locking.
- **Eventual Consistency:** Suitable for distributed databases.
- **Built-in Replication:** Supports master-master and master-slave configurations.

## 2. CouchDB Architecture
CouchDB is designed for distributed computing with high availability and fault tolerance. It consists of several key components:

- **Storage Engine:** Uses a B-tree index structure for efficient data retrieval.
- **Document Store:** Stores JSON-based documents.
- **Views and Indexing:** Uses MapReduce for querying and data aggregation.
- **Replication Engine:** Facilitates database synchronization across multiple nodes.
- **HTTP API:** Provides a simple interface for interacting with the database.

## 3. Data Model in CouchDB
CouchDB follows a schema-free approach, where each record is stored as a JSON document with a unique `_id` field. The flexible schema allows different documents to have different structures.

### Components of a CouchDB Document:
- **_id:** Unique identifier for each document.
- **_rev:** Revision ID used for version control.
- **User-Defined Fields:** Can contain nested JSON structures.

Example document:
```json
{
  "_id": "12345",
  "_rev": "1-abc",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
```

## 4. MapReduce and Views
CouchDB uses MapReduce to enable complex queries without predefined schemas. Views in CouchDB are predefined queries stored in design documents.

### Map Function Example:
```json
{"map": "function(doc) { emit(doc.name, doc.email); }"}
```
This function emits key-value pairs where `name` is the key and `email` is the value.

### Reduce Function Example:
```json
{"reduce": "function(keys, values) { return values.length; }"}
```
This function calculates the total number of emitted documents.

## 5. CouchDB Replication
Replication allows data synchronization between different CouchDB instances. There are two main types:
- **Master-Master Replication:** Enables multiple writable copies of the database.
- **Master-Slave Replication:** Allows one writable master and multiple read-only slaves.

Replication can be triggered manually or set up for continuous synchronization.

## 6. Security and Authentication
CouchDB provides security mechanisms to control access and protect data.

### Authentication Methods:
- **Basic Authentication:** Uses usernames and passwords.
- **OAuth Authentication:** Supports token-based authentication.
- **Cookie Authentication:** Uses session cookies for secure access.

### Database Security:
- **Admin Roles:** Can create and manage databases.
- **User Roles:** Have restricted access based on assigned privileges.

## 7. Use Cases of CouchDB
CouchDB is widely used in scenarios requiring offline-first capabilities and distributed data storage.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Offline-First Applications:** Ideal for mobile and web apps that need local storage.
- **Big Data and IoT:** Handles high-velocity, high-volume data efficiently.
- **Content Management Systems:** Supports unstructured data for CMS platforms.
- **Distributed Systems:** Facilitates cross-region data synchronization.

## 8. Assignments and Exercises
To deepen your understanding of CouchDB, complete the following exercises:

### Assignment 1: Setting Up CouchDB
1. Install CouchDB on your system.
2. Create a new database named `students`.
3. Insert three sample documents with different structures.

### Assignment 2: Creating Views
1. Define a map function to retrieve all documents sorted by a specific field.
2. Implement a reduce function to count the total number of documents.

### Assignment 3: Implementing Replication
1. Set up replication between two CouchDB instances.
2. Verify data consistency across both instances.
3. Create a conflict scenario and resolve it manually.

### Assignment 4: Security Implementation
1. Create admin and user roles.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to different user roles.
3. Implement authentication and test API access restrictions.
